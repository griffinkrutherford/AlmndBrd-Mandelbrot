/**
 * @file Language: C++.h
 * @brief Development notes regarding C++ usage in the AlmndBrd-Mandelbrot project
 * 
 * This file outlines the C++ language requirements, features, and best practices
 * to be used throughout the project implementation.
 */

/**
 * === C++ Standard and Compatibility ===
 * 
 * 1. C++ Standard
 *    - The project uses C++17 as the baseline standard
 *    - Certain modules may utilize C++20 features if available
 *    - Backward compatibility with C++14 should be maintained where feasible
 * 
 * 2. Compiler Support
 *    - Primary: GCC 9.0+ and Clang 10.0+
 *    - Secondary: MSVC 19.20+ (Visual Studio 2019+)
 *    - Compiler-specific extensions should be avoided
 * 
 * 3. Platform Targets
 *    - Linux (primary development platform)
 *    - macOS (supported for all features)
 *    - Windows (supported via MSVC and MinGW/Cygwin)
 *    - Cross-platform compatibility is a priority

/**
 * === Language Features ===
 * 
 * 1. Core Features
 *    - Use of move semantics for efficient resource management
 *    - RAII principles for resource handling
 *    - Template metaprogramming for generic algorithms
 *    - Constexpr evaluation for compile-time calculations
 * 
 * 2. Modern C++ Features to Utilize
 *    - auto type deduction where it improves readability
 *    - Range-based for loops for container iteration
 *    - Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) for memory management
 *    - Lambda functions for callbacks and algorithms
 *    - std::optional for potentially missing values
 *    - Structured bindings for multi-value returns
 * 
 * 3. C++17 Specific Features
 *    - std::filesystem for file operations
 *    - std::variant for type-safe unions
 *    - Fold expressions for template parameter packs
 *    - constexpr if for compile-time conditionals
 *    - Parallel algorithms from STL where applicable
 * 
 * 4. Libraries and Dependencies
 *    - STL for core data structures and algorithms
 *    - Eigen for linear algebra (if needed)
 *    - libpng/libjpeg for image output
 *    - OpenMP for CPU parallelization
 *    - CUDA/OpenCL for GPU acceleration (optional)

/**
 * === Coding Style Guidelines ===
 * 
 * 1. Naming Conventions
 *    - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., MandelbrotCalculator)
 *    - Functions and methods: camelCase (e.g., calculateIterations)
 *    - Variables: camelCase (e.g., maxIterations)
 *    - Constants and enums: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_ITERATION_LIMIT)
 *    - Private member variables: mCamelCase or camelCase_ (e.g., mMaxIterations)
 * 
 * 2. Code Organization
 *    - One class per header/source file pair when possible
 *    - Related classes can be grouped in the same namespace
 *    - Implementation details in private/anonymous namespaces
 *    - Interface and implementation separated when appropriate
 * 
 * 3. Documentation
 *    - Doxygen-style comments for public APIs
 *    - Brief descriptions for all functions and classes
 *    - Detailed parameter and return value documentation
 *    - Examples for complex functionality
 * 
 * 4. Error Handling
 *    - Exceptions for exceptional conditions
 *    - Error codes for expected failure cases
 *    - Assertion for programming errors and invariant checking
 *    - Input validation at API boundaries

/**
 * === Performance Considerations ===
 * 
 * 1. Memory Management
 *    - Prefer stack allocation for small objects
 *    - Use custom allocators for performance-critical sections
 *    - Consider memory layout for cache efficiency
 *    - Minimize dynamic allocation in tight loops
 * 
 * 2. Computation Optimization
 *    - Use SIMD instructions for parallel data processing
 *    - Implement multi-threading for CPU-intensive operations
 *    - Consider GPU offloading for massive parallelism
 *    - Profile and optimize critical paths
 * 
 * 3. Template Specialization
 *    - Provide optimized implementations for common types
 *    - Use compile-time computation where applicable
 *    - Balance template flexibility with compilation time
 * 
 * 4. Algorithm Selection
 *    - Choose algorithms with appropriate complexity for the task
 *    - Consider cache locality in algorithm implementation
 *    - Benchmark alternative approaches for critical sections
 *    - Use standard library algorithms where appropriate
 */

/**
 * === Testing and Quality Assurance ===
 * 
 * 1. Unit Testing
 *    - Use Catch2 or Google Test framework
 *    - Aim for high test coverage of core functionality
 *    - Include edge cases and performance regression tests
 * 
 * 2. Static Analysis
 *    - Use clang-tidy for static code analysis
 *    - Enable compiler warnings and treat them as errors
 *    - Integrate Coverity or similar tools in CI pipeline
 * 
 * 3. Runtime Checking
 *    - Use Address Sanitizer for memory error detection
 *    - Use Undefined Behavior Sanitizer for undefined behavior
 *    - Consider Thread Sanitizer for concurrency issues
 * 
 * 4. Benchmarking
 *    - Establish performance baselines for key operations
 *    - Use Google Benchmark or similar for micro-benchmarks
 *    - Track performance metrics across development
